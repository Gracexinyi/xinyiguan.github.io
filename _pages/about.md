Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in operations management at UCLA Anderson School of Management, where I am advised by Prof. [Velibor Mišić](https://vvmisic.github.io/).

I am on the 2023-2024 academic job market.

Research Interests
======
My research centers around proposing data-driven methodologies for problems involving decision making under uncertainty. Currently, my focus is mainly on two areas: revenue management and pricing; and the intersection of machine learning and optimization.
