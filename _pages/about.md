Hi! I am Xinyi, a Ph.D. student in operations management at UCLA Anderson School of Management.

Research Interests

My research centers around proposing data-driven methodologies for the problems involving decision making under uncertainty. Currently, my focus is mainly on two areas: revenue management and pricing; and the intersection of machine learning and optimization.
