Hi! I am an Assistant Professor at [Hong Kong PolyU Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/lms/). I received my PhD in operations management from UCLA Anderson School of Management, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Velibor Mišić](https://vvmisic.github.io/). I also received my master’s degree from UCLA Anderson School of Management and bachelor’s degree from Peking University.



Research Interests
======
My research centers around proposing data-driven methodologies for problems involving decision making under uncertainty. Currently, my focus is mainly on two areas: revenue management and pricing; and the intersection of machine learning and optimization.
