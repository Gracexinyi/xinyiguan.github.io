I will be presenting two talks at the 2023 INFORMS Annual Conference:
* Title: Randomized Robust Price Optimization
  * Session: SC04. Online Decision Making Algorithms.
  * Time: October 15 (Sunday), 12:45 PM - 2:00 PM MST.
  * Location: CC-North 121A
* Title: Randomized Policy Optimization for Optimal Stopping
  * Session: MC73. Finance Student Awards.
  * Time: October 16 (Monday), 12:45 PM - 2:00 PM MST.
  * Location: CC-West 106B

Research Interests
======
My research centers around proposing data-driven methodologies for problems involving decision making under uncertainty. Currently, my focus is mainly on two areas: revenue management and pricing; and the intersection of machine learning and optimization.
